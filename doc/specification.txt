As a user I want to record search points with 
  Postal Code,
  Distance Range,
  Minimum Price,
  Maximum Price, and
  Category
which are gonna be used to query craigslist.
These data are gonna be triggered manually or set in the system to be automatically dispatched.

The answers of these queries are gonna be recorded in a database and each time the query runs, it will recorde the answers.
But if there is already a PID, the system will only record if either Price, Date or Title has changed.

As a user, I wanna receive an email each time there is a change in the database.
The email should contain:
  PID,
  Title,
  Images,
  Maps location,
  Description
